  <!-- ************************ SECTION: OVERVIEW ************************ -->
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  I applied for my Canada working holiday visa in 2023. As a part of the application, one is also required to enroll biometrics and schedule for a medical test. Since the biometrics centers in Japan are only in Tokyo and Osaka, far from my parents' home, I opted to apply in Malaysia, where Japanese citizens can stay visa-free for up to 90 days. While waiting for my application to process, I volunteered at a hostel in Langkawi.
